				<p>We have four types of training under this category: Accounting Software, Microsoft products, Soft Skills and occasional Seminars/Workshops.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>ACCOUNTING SOFTWARE TRAINING</li>
					<p>Accounting software training which comprises of Sage 50 Accounting Software and Quickbooks Accounting Software. We have provided training in accounting software for almost two decades and for hundreds of people. Many of those we trained are living testimonies of our quality, all-encompassing training, which has facilitated their rapid career growth and confidence in the work place.</p>
					<li>MICROSOFT PRODUCTS</li>
					<p>Our offerings include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							EXCEL (Basic – Advanced). Our Excel training is unique because it comes with business and finance bias, which makes it very practical and ready for the work place.
						</li>
						<li>
							POWER POINT presentation.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<li>SOFTSKILLS</li>
					<p>Experience has shown that those who succeed the most are not usually the people with the highest I.Q. or the most impressive line-up of paper credentials. The most success is recorded by people with the appropriate soft skills. They are the ones who lead others successfully, they are the ones who conquer where others fail, they are the ones who make the difference generally. If you desire to experience resounding success in your career – whatever field it is – you will need to support your technical skills with soft skills, such as Positive Attitude Skills, Supervision Skills, Leadership Skills, Negotiation Skills, etc.</p>
					<p>In today’s world, soft skills are considered the most essential skills you will ever need to make a success in your career.</p>
					<li>SEMINARS/WORKSHOPS</li>
					<p>We organize seminars or workshops occasionally for hands-on but insightful short training on various topics. Many of our attendees in the past have expressed pleasant surprises at the depth of learning they were able to achieve within a period as short as 3 days.</p>
					<p>The contributions that various attendees bring to the venue provides invaluable enrichment to our seminars. Usually the attendees are well informed and well experienced people in their work places. They are able to rob off positively on each other and return to their various offices, refreshed and well equipped for greater challenges and responsibility. The networking that usually comes with our seminars/workshops have been big plusses for our attendees.</p>
					<p>The value of our miscellaneous trainings far outweigh the cost of attendance and will continue to remain so.</p>
