of one thousand naira (1000,00) which is not refundable as advertised on-air or
online. Please be aware that shortcodes may change from Competition to
Competition.  You may need to check with your service provider for details of
phone network compatibility.  You will pay any text messaging charges via your
service provider.

making, or attempting to make, multiple votes.
3.7          For each on-air Competition all timings including the closing time are as
broadcast on the Station&#39;s FM broadcast frequency. If you are listening via an IP
enabled device such as a smartphone or tablet, please remember that the stream
can be slightly behind the FM broadcast due to differences in network speeds
and/or the advertising we serve to listeners on IP enabled devices. If a
Competition requires you to enter by a deadline dependent on an item in the
broadcast (e.g. by the end of a song) we cannot take into account any delay from
listening via an IP enabled device and the deadline will be as on the FM
broadcast, so please take this into account when entering a Competition.
